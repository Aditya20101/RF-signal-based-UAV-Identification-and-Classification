# RF-signal-based-UAV-Identification-and-Classification
RF Based UAV Detection and Defense Systems have
become increasingly important as the use of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) continues to grow in popularity. Deep learning,
a subset of machine learning, has shown great potential for
improving the accuracy and reliability of these systems. In this
study a machine learning based approach for detection and
classification of radio frequency signals from drones is proposed.
As data source the DroneDetectV2 data set is used. Specifically,
we focus on the application of deep learning techniques for UAV
detection and classification using RF signals. We also discuss
the challenges involved in training deep learning models for
UAV detection and propose possible solutions to overcome these
challenges. In this study, we have compared the classification
results for two cases, while taking/ not taking flight modes
of the drones into consideration. The results of this study
demonstrate that deep learning can significantly enhance the
accuracy and reliability of RF-based UAV detection and defense
systems, making them an effective tool for protecting critical
infrastructure and public safety.
